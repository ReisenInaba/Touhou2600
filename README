Touhou for Atari 2600...need I explain more about the purpose of this project?

If you'd like to try this on an emulator, download touhou.bas.bin. If you want to try hacking at the source, look at touhou.bas.

This project has a long way to go before it even resembles Touhou, heck with the Atari's limitation it might as well be River Raid with underage girls.

Controls: Very simple - Directions to move and fire to shoot.
